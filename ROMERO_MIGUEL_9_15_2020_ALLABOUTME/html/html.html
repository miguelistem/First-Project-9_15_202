<h1>All about me</h1>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Mr.berta, I am Miguel the dude who is always in chat. One of my favorite things to do in my
    <br>free time is workout. At this point I think i have changed my “athletic” type 3 times. The first one
    <br>being is when I wanted to work on my calisthenics; I truly believed I would get strong just doing
    <br>push ups which it did eventually lead to that. I trained that for a year in middle school/freshman
    <br>year and at the end of it I was able to do 83 push ups, 20 pull ups, and about 60 bodyweight squats.
    <br>So I picked up lifting and was roughly doing it on and off not really being serious about the topic.
    <br>Close to the end of the third semester, one of my friends asked me to pick up track which I did
    <br>solely because he promised to carry me under his wing as I had no idea what track was. Now Ryan has
    <br>been doing this for 1-2 years and seriously at that, I beat him in 3 months at the mile. I ran a time of
    <br>5:30 and he ran 5:32. He was a sore loser but I didn’t take it seriously until I noticed the amount of
    <br>girls at track though now I understand that this is his thing and I probably shouldn’t take his spot.
    <br>After Ryan deterred me from track, I picked up lifting again but it didn’t become serious until I asked my
    <br>friend Isaac, a kid with my body type, to join. He seriously took me up on my offer and because of it
    <br>I was “forced” to get serious about training. This ended up in us religiously training for about a year
    <br>together and by the end of it we loved it. I was able to max out my deadlift at 335, bench at 160,
    <br>and squat at 245. That was cool and all but I didn’t notice how strong I did become until I tested out
    <br>my bodyweight strength, I decided to do them weighted and got 20 pushups with a 45lb plate, a
    <br>max chin up with 75lb, I was repping pullups with a 45lb plate, and I ended up doing 12 muscles up
    <br>from a dead hang no swinging. I may have the video and might put it somewhere if i can.  Actually
    <br>the muscles ups took like 1 month to master honestly, I hated every second of attempting my first
    <br>one because I would always hit my chest. This is what I do in my free time its not bad I just had a
    <br>struggled with my diet at the start and even now because the amount of calories and water you need
    <br>to keep this up is exhausting.  At the same time, even though my physical body may be free of
    <br>DOMs, my nervous system could be jacked up and that affects my gains. Its complex in the long run
    <br>but healthy for myself and enjoyable. Even though I am a potato now because of Covid and being
    <br>kicked out of my old gym for irrational reasons on the owners behalf, I am planning a comeback at
    <br>another gym that is farther but has more equipment, it usually was my gym in the summer. Isaac is
    <br>doing great I am happy to be a mentor even though I just taught him what I knew at the time. After
    <br>reading this grammar wise and all that stuff its just terrible. I am just talking mate like I would
    <br>in my head.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current plans for highschool is to chill out. I noticed I am more stressed out when I don’t pay
    <br>attention in class or play Tetris than actually doing above and beyond. I cant be stressed about
    <br>grades or ap classes to a degree. The current ap class I am just doing for fun as I took the
    <br> “debatable” harder version of the class last year. Right now I have am planning to do a bunch of test out
    <br>option for credit such as clep or ace accepted credit. This is mostly because I would like to apply to
    <br>a decent accredited university which would accept all my alternate forms of credit. I have one in
    <br>mind and it seems to be a viable choice, I will obviously apply to other schools. Testing out may help
    <br>me clear my generals and skip a year or more I hope; I will most likely take several classes at once
    <br>and basically hopefully finish in 3 years. The school in my head has a pretty affordable fixed rate
    <br>cost of credit that I think I can actually pay off independently with a job. So I will gladly go indebt for
    <br>a masters if I finish in 3 years. Between this I will probably take internships and make sure I
    <br>understand I could do the job. And bam all that probably will help me get a job. Now what is this
    <br>career choice, happy you would ask Software Engineering. This stemmed from exploiting my
    <br>Nintendo with kiddie scripts to geting access to all the free games I could get and it got to the point
    <br>I could change the start up animation of the device. A few years later I got an xbox 360 and
    <br>exploited that like a kid. I was the dude that would mess up every call of duty lobby for a couple
    <br>months until I got Minecraft and just played the game. I mean pretty much a bunch of illegal stuff
    <br>but I was a minor (lol I am acting as if I am old because I am 17). It wasn’t until I met my rival Fidel
    <br>that I was introduced to pcs and their hardware. He seemed enamored by it and I wanted to know
    <br>all the hype around it. Did my research and noticed that every device we had was a pc but it just ran
    <br>on a different system. Time went on me and Fidel got into stem and bam now he and me have a
    <br>bunch of debates and discussions about life and etc. I did some python stuff this summer and it was
    <br>pretty fun. I enjoyed finding the errors in my syntax when my terminal went crazy about wrong
    <br>syntax. I also like the career choices in being computer literate. Like I could aim to work at
    <br>Neuralink, a big corporation, or do freelancing. I can even travel and become one of those dudes
    <br>that say “passive income I control everything through this computer.” Like seriously all I have to do
    <br>is have internet and a decent laptop. After that I will probably just become a mad lad and do crazy
    <br>science experiments in my basement. I mean a job is a job so I will probably spend my days
    <br>spending time exploring my curiosities. I mean for all i care i could end up as a potatoe farmer
    <br> just happy about the great season and life. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks">Thank you for visiting my Ted Talk</a>

    <figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">Hello mate, this video was made in October of 2019. That was a long time ago. I can't lie
        <br>it was pretty awkward doing these lifts because I actually felt people staring at me like an animal.
        <br>My deadlift looks somewhat dirty but I was still lifting 250 so I will let it pass. Back to a time I
        <br>was a little shy about training. Like it definitely felt weird having eyes on me especially the day
        <br>When I was doing sets of weighted pulls ups with 55lb. Some people doing dropsets infront of me were
        <br>commenting about how if they had my bodyweight, they would also do that. I out deadlifted them the
        <br> following week. Actually thats a lie, my boy Isaac did because i was too taxed out to continue. Bro
        <br>I remember that deadlift belt. We called it the lucky one because it was on the verge of dying. I got
        <br>a lever one, once i started pulling heavier stuff and needed the support</font> <figcaption>

    <figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">This is how crazy me and Ryan were. He asked me if i wanted to go for a run.
    <br>I said sure but it was gonna rain soon. I end up coming late and the dude still trained
        <br>with me. We were soaked wet when we got into our rides but it felt worth it almost.
    <br>Like I am not going to be training while its raining anytime soon but it should
        <br>definitely be on your once in a lifetime list.<font size="-1>"</figcaption>

    <figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">This is was the first time I did muscle ups for sets. I can't lie i felt on top of the world.
        <br>Quite literally, the gym has wallpapers of buildings to look at when your up there.
        <br>I think this was August 1st of 2019, so very early on. I was probably lifting for a
        <br>couple months at the time. I think this was a week after mastering my first muscle up.
        <br>This was after a workout but I had to do it because there was some girls behind us at
        <br>the time and I just had to do it. Basically stick floating in the air.<font size="-1>"</figcaption>

    <figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="-1">I remember this day, it was cold and windy but the trees looked alive I felt like
        <br>they were waving at me. Moments like this in life really make me think about everything.
        <br>The concept of nature just feels so nostalgic almost as if at some point I was a part of
        <br>it. Its good to swing and reflect on life sometimes. Just swinging.<font size="-1>"</figcaption>
